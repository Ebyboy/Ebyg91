        <p>
            The President of Nigeria is elected using a modified two-round system with up to three rounds. To be elected
            in the first round, a candidate must receive a plurality of the votes and over of the vote in at least 24 of
            the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. If no candidate passes this threshold, a second round will
            be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a majority of votes in the highest
            number of states. In the second round, a candidate still must receive the most votes and over 25% of the
            vote in at least 24 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory to be elected. If neither candidate
            passes this threshold, a third round will be held where just majority of the votes is required to be
            elected.
